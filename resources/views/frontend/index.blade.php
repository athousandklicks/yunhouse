Tell her how her descendants have evolved, the hatred, the love, the variety of skin colours, the multiplicity of human habits as in cultures and traditions across the globe. Millennia of everything human, the wars, the atrocities, man’s inhumanity to man… Can you imagine Fleet Street reaction if the story had been that the mother of the entire human race was European?</p>

                                                <h2 class="entry-details">In the year 1884, in the German City of Berlin, representatives of major European nations gathered around a giant map of the continent of Africa for the biggest imperialistic banquet in the history of mankind. Slices of the Dark Continent were served out to satisfy imperial hunger for territories – The Scramble For Africa – that had reached fever pitch.</h2>

                                                <h2 class="entry-details">There is no record of any Africans’ presence at the Berlin Conference. Nor any evidence that Africans were ever informed or knew about the meeting. In fact, Africans got to know about the carve-up of their continent when Europeans turned up on their homelands with all manner of ploys to assert and claim the territorial possessions as apportioned in Berlin. The process was called The Pacification Of The Natives.</h2>

                                                <h2 class="entry-details">Yunhouse is founded by Africans whose personal experience of The Pacification Of The Natives is the Europeanisation of their minds through European education. Foundation inhabitants of Yunhouse identify themselves as a generation of Africans born within blood-dripping distance of The Great Berlin Carve-up.
