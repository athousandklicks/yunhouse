                            <p class="lead">In the year 1884, in the German City of Berlin, representatives of major European nations gathered around a giant map of the continent of Africa for the biggest imperialistic banquet in the history of mankind. Slices of the Dark Continent were served out to satisfy imperial hunger for territories – The Scramble For Africa – that had reached fever pitch.</p>

                            <div id="post-content">
                                <p>There is no record of any Africans’ presence at the Berlin Conference. Nor any evidence that Africans were ever informed or knew about the meeting. In fact, Africans got to know about the carve-up of their continent when Europeans turned up on their homelands with all manner of ploys to assert and claim the territorial possessions as apportioned in Berlin. The process was called The Pacification Of The Natives.</p>

                                <p class="lead">The 20th Century was drawing to a close when the press release came: “ALL HUMANS ON PLANET EARTH ARE DESCENDED FROM AN AFRICAN WOMAN”.</p>

<p class="lead">I screamed! to the hearing of all humans present in the London Fleet Street newsroom, where I was still swaggering in the euphoria of my very recently acquired status of first ever full-blooded African with a bona fide appellation of Fleet Street Journalist. The News Editor, who announced my appointment, said my position was an overdue 20th Century phenomenon that had been precipitated by a chance meeting at the 20th birthday party of his niece (student of Chinese language), whose current co-fornicator (an African who spoke and wrote fluent Japanese) had brought along (from Brixton) two African mates, one of whom spoke and wrote fluent Russian, and myself, an indigene of a former British Colony, where he (Fleet Street Editor) had been conceived (five decades earlier) during an imperial copulation between his father (Colonial Governor) and his mother (a blood relation of the last Emperor of Russia).</p>

<p class="lead">‘The globe has become one village’, the News Editor proclaimed with much excitement. He got more excited when he learnt that I was currently engaged in pamphleteering on a subject that was burning – even as we spoke – on the streets of Brixton District in South London. Our publication, The Atlantic Storm, tracked day by the day the sordid details of Black people’s experience of the historic racial implosion with which Brixton eventually got baptised as Ethnic Headquarters Of Great Britain. The Atlantic Storm was in newspaper format and appeared daily, .</p>

                                <p class="lead">LAST CHRISTMAS HAPPENED one thousand nine hundred and seventy-three hours ago. I counted them. This is the sort of thing you do when you are actively hibernating, like I have been doing. And it came to pass, that for nearly two thousand hours I’ve consciously and very happily cheated the English winter. Thanks to the authorities of Yunhouse where the policy is not to spare North Sea gas so as to maintain tropicalised environment. (House Rule Number 1A: Yunhouse and all its appurtenances are African in every particular and must be so regarded at all times).</p>

<p class="lead">However, this winter saw Yunhouse temperature rise well above tropical level. The source of that extra heat is my hibernation corner: Hut 007, a Yunhouse dwelling in which an African lived through World War One as well as World War Two and died in fear of counting any further. That African is Dr Cyril Naikule, LL.B, BA, MPhil, PhD. This is the famous Cy, pronounced sii-wai or see-why, depending on how much meaning you wish to attach to the name in the Yun-legend that says an African once lived, studied, wrote and died for the continent shaped like a question mark. Hut 007 holds the complete set of Something To Write Home About, the final title for a writing expedition that its author once thought to call Through A Black Eye. It is a neat arrangement of forty-seven volumes in hardback notebooks numbered with Roman numerals, the contents are penned in exquisite cursive of the days before the skill of handwriting became separated from the art of calligraphy. </p>
