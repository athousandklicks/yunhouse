                            The devoted Yunhouse Secretary whom everyone knows but who hardly talks to anyone. The young lady from Shropshire is sightseeing at Westminster when she is swept – literally – off her feet by the tumult that greets the Law Lords’ verdict that Africa House rightfully belongs to the Africans. Seated in the electrified atmosphere of jubilation, she humbly asks if there is anything she could do. She is asked to take notes. And she begins to take notes, and continues to do so from her permanent position at the right hand of the Palaver Hall Chairman (Uncle Lekwot). Four decades later she is voted The Secretary Who Has Typed Africa More Times Than Any Secretary In The Whole World. The full record of the proceedings of Palaver Hall is Beryl’s creation.
