                     <p>This first ever pan-Africa news magazine is launched in the second decade of the twentieth century from the publishing stable of the World Chronicle [WC] whose publisher had an uncle who sat as a British delegate at the 1884 Berlin Conference. The publication is conceived as a medium for Englishmen to cross-fertilise their ideas and experiences of Africa. The publisher does not have African readership in mind. Yet the magazine becomes a must-read for Africans living London. The magazine is, without any doubt, the best – if not the only – chronicle of The Pacification Of The Natives. Palaver Hall library has all the issues of the magazine.</p>
