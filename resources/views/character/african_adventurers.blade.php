                     <p>Members of the Adventurers Club do not call themselves Africanists. But everyone else does. And its founder John Oâ€™Gafla is not only happy to be called an Africanist, he even claims credit for coining the term. The members say the Adventurers is a place to meet and discuss Africa objectively which, the members believe, is not possible in the highly charged atmosphere of Yunhouse.</p>
