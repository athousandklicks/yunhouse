                     <p>Initially there were eleven Africans who resolved to form themselves into the Berliner Cult, their motto: We Shall Never Be Pacified!. They mixed their bloods in a jar of hot water and drank it. Ritual is repeated with each additional member until membership reached twenty-three (The Core-23), the number that appended their signatures to the possession documents of Yunhouse after fighting and winning the First Battle Of Yunhouse. The Berliner Cultâ€™s anti-colonialism stance is the essence of the Yunhouse story which concludes with Ogesayi Mawe [One And Only Wandering President] as the last surviving  member as The Core-23</p>
