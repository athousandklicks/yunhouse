                            An Englishman and Editor-in-chief of The Africa Picture [No Spitting!] for over sixty years. His involvement with Africa begins in Yunhouse following introduction by Big Mnama who knew him earlier from Oxford. His journalistic career begins with freelance contributions of articles on the proceedings of Palaver Hall of Yunhouse. ‘I am an African’ John tells the publisher in the interview for full-time job on The Picture. On getting the job, John checks out of Yunhouse. It would be a glorious career that earns him knighthood from the English Crown as well recognition as the Number One Africanist (he claims copyright for the coinage). His numerous obituaries referred to him as Mr Africa: The Man Who Most Probably Has Written Africa More Times Than Anyone Else Under The Sun.</p>
                            <p class="lead">John O’Gafla is the founder member of the first ever batch of The Africa Correspondents, an informal pints gang of real ale enthusiasts in Fleet Street which metamorphoses into The Africa Adventurers Club. His one African dream is to witness the amalgamation of Yunhouse with The Adventurers. But he, of all people, knows that the task would be as difficult as it would be for him (certificated obese all his life) Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (title of his unpublished memoirs). Especially given the well-known fact that he is the principal architect in the establishment of AFC (Africa Freedom Council) with which reconciliation with Yunhouse is beyond imagination.
