                     <p>He was a cute looking toddler spotted (in the company of his gardener father) on the lawns of a Colonial State House by an English aristocrat (Lord Kemp) visiting his cousin, the Governor General. Mnama was adopted by gubernatorial fiat. He is given everything his foster father could give, including a ring with the family heraldic crest. He gets classic upper class education, public school, Oxford, etc. Wherever he goes, the impression of his six-foot-six persona was the same: “an overpowering aura of an extraordinary specimen of homo sapiens” – a newspaper report. He speaks very little, as Cy quickly observes when the two meet while Big Mnama is perambulating in the campus of London University in search of his next move in life. No one is certain if he ever uttered ‘We shall never be pacified!’. But he found the Berliners to be good for a laugh. And he tells his father so. His father confirms that it was unfair for the Berliners to be evicted from their Camden Town flat simply because they enjoy good laughs at their meetings. Lord Kemp wills his Hampstead estate to Big Mnama and his fellow Berliners. The will is challenged by Big Mnama’s niece and the First Battle For Yunhouse ensues. Also Lord Kemp’s death induces a crisis for the English constitution: could Big Mnama inherit his father’s title or not?</p>
