                            Cy, as he is known to everyone in Yunhouse, is named after a Welshman who was a guest at his naming ceremony (c1890). The Welsh namesake had been a chef in the service of an uncle who swapped from selling slaves to selling spices to the same English trading company that facilitated -with multiple treaties – The Pacification Of The Natives in Cy’s colonial country.</p>
                            
                            <p class="lead">Cy’s European education began with German missionaries but finishes in an English school because the Berlin Carve-up inserted a national boundary bang in the middle of his ethnic domain. This is one childhood experience, Cy claims, that set his African Brain Cell in perpetual motion of anger.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Cy’s numerous escapades as the Angry Man Of Africa are widely publicised and they are the live wire of the story of Yunhouse. His initial encounter with the co-anchor of Yunhouse, Lekwot Abaka, is to pick a fight because he is nauseated by an article Lekwot contributed to the maiden edition The Africa Picture [No spitting!]. But there is no fight. Instead, the two bond into a partnership that becomes the foundation on which Yunhouse would stand.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Cy organises many protests against the manifestations of The Pacification Of The Natives. He coordinates the race riots that greet the lower court ruling against the Africans in the First Battle For Yunhouse. He leads the march – to the Colonial Office – against inclusion of Africans in the World War II. He persists in his personal expression of opposition to WW II by running in the streets during bombs raids in London. Fearing for his safety, fellow Berliners organise a voyage back home to Africa. On his native soil, he tries unsuccessfully to stop young Africans from being recruited to fight for the English Crown. He later organises the same youngby ex-soldiers demanding payment for their sacrifices in the European war. He fights against the imposition of Clan Tax on his people. He is arrested severally by the Colonial Administration. He travels back to London to formally present his peoples’ case to the British Government. Colonial security reports refer to him as “communist”, “warrior”, “agitator”, “terrorist”, “traitor”, etc etc. The contents of the Colonial Office’s dossier on him make the bulk of the evidence for the opposition’s case in The First Battle For Yunhouse.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Cy is an accomplished academic scholar with two-and-half Ph D’s. He read all volumes on the subject of Africa in the University Library. According to him, he became a compulsive scribbler from the day an Irish missionary gave him his first lead pencil. His last years are spent working mainly on his memoir, Something To Write Home About. The manuscript inspires the young African research journalist who is the narrator of the story of Yunhouse.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Cy dies (c1994) while working on the case against the takeover of Yunhouse by rival Adventurers Club.</p>
