                            Cyril NAIKULE: Cy [mostly pronounced see-why otherwise sii-wai] as he is known to everyone in
Yunhouse, is named after a Welshman who was a
guest at his naming ceremony (c1890). The Welsh
namesake had been a chef in the service of an uncle who swapped
from selling slaves to selling spices to the same English trading
company that facilitated -with multiple treaties - The Pacification
Of The Natives in Cy's colonised home country. Cy discovers
much, much later that the same English trading company, in a
gentleman’s agreement with his uncle, has sponsored his
education in London.</p>
                            
                            <p class="lead">Cy's European education began with German missionaries
but finishes in an English school because the Berlin Carve-up
inserted a national boundary bang in the middle of his ethnic
domain. This is one childhood experience, Cy claims, that set his
African Brain Cell in perpetual motion of anger. Cy's numerous
escapades as the Angry Man Of Africa are widely publicised and
they are the live wires of the story of Yunhouse.</p>

                            <p class="lead">His initial encounter with the co-anchor of Yunhouse,
Lekwot Abaka, is to pick a fight because he is nauseated by an
article Lekwot contributed to the maiden edition of the primeval
African journal -The Africa Picture [No spitting!]. Instead of a
fight, the two bond into a partnership that becomes the foundation
on which Yunhouse would stand.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Cy organises many protests against the manifestations of
The Pacification Of The Natives. He coordinates the race riots that
greet the lower court ruling against the Africans in The First
Battle For Yunhouse. He leads the march against inclusion of
Africans in their World War II. He expresses personal opposition
to WW II by running in the streets during bombs raids in London.
Fearing for his safety, fellow Berliners organise a voyage back
home to Africa. On his native soil, he tries unsuccessfully to stopyoung Africans from being recruited to fight for the English
Crown. He organises the same young Africans to demand
payment for their sacrifices in the European war. He opposes the
imposition of Clan Tax on his people. He returns to London to
present his peoples' case to the British Government. The Colonial
Office's dossier on him make the bulk of the evidence for the
opposition's case in The First Battle For Yunhouse.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Cy’s autobiography, The Chips On My Shoulder - Being An
Epistle To The Africans In London, is regarded as the Spiritual
Manifesto of Yunhouse. His memoirs, Something To Write Home
About, inspires the young African research journalist who is the
Narrator of The Yunhouse Story. Cy dies (c1994) while
working on the case against the takeover of Yunhouse by rival
Africa Adventurers Club.</p>
